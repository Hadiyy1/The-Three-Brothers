Will we quell the dissent, or acknowledge the legitimate grievances of our industrial backbone?"

This renewed religious zeal challenges the established authority of the State Church and can lead to the formation of new free churches or an increased focus on moralistic values. While it may strengthen the Devout, it could also cause friction within communities and pose questions about religious freedom and state control over faith."
 sweden_flavor.23.f: "The Word of God burns bright in the hearts of the faithful, illuminating a path beyond the established order."
